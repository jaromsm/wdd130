                <h1>Expertise - The Skill</h1>
                <p>Expertise refers to the excellence of the craftsman behind the work. How replicable is it, regardless of whether or not someone else could have come up with it easily or if it makes you feel a certain way or not? Do you have to be in the top 1% of the top 1% of skilled performers in your domain to even begin attempting recreation? If so, you’ve probably found some high expertise music.</p>

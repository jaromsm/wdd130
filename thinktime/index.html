                <h1>The 3 Elements of Media</h1>
                <p>Why is an artistic masterpiece to one person hardly worth a listen to another? Why is the song you hate most another’s all-time favorite? Why do genres speak so differently to so many people, and yet often times people predictably like similar ‘kinds’ of music. What even are ‘kinds’ of music? While I certainly don’t know, my hope here is to suggest a theory that seems to carry some weight in explaining these strange phenomena.</p>
                <p>I believe it begins with a breakdown of the ‘draws’ of music into 3 basic buckets: vibe, creativity, and expertise. My theory is that people value those 3 elements to varying levels and therefore ‘connect’ with or like music which matches their preferences. Most like all 3, but not equally. Each typically lies above or below the others.</p>

                <h1>Vibe</h1>
                <p>The simplest of the three, in my opinion, is vibe. Vibe essentially refers to the feeling of the music. What kind of tone does it set? Does it seem to highjack your emotional systems and get you into ‘the feels,’ whether breakup depression or a new-romance high.

            <section id="expertise">
                <h1>Expertise</h1>
                <p>Expertise refers to the excellence of the craftsman behind the work. How replicable is it, regardless of whether or not someone else could have come up with it easily or if it makes you feel a certain way or not? Do you have to be in the top 1% of the top 1% of skilled performers in your domain to even begin attempting recreation? If so, you’ve probably found some high expertise music.</p>

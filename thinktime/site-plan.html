      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose is to provide an explanation of a theory. The theory is simply about ways to classify the different primary values of media (particularly music, but also movies and perhaps many other forms of media though I have not explored the connotations for those myself).</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is those who are curious why some songs or music really resonate with them while others don't, and why that changes so much from person to person. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        <br>Why is an artistic masterpiece to one person hardly worth a listen to another? Why is the song you hate most another’s all time favorite? Why do genres speak so differently to so many people, and yet often times people predictably like similar ‘kinds’ of music. What even are ‘kinds’ of music? While I certainly don’t know, my hope here is to suggests a theory that seems to carry some weight in explaining these strange phenomena. I

<br>it begins with a breakdown of the ‘draws’ of music into 3 basic buckets: vibe, creativity, and expertise. My theory is that people value those 3 elements to varying levels and therefore ‘connect’ with or like music which matches their preferences. Most like all 3, but not equally. Each typically lies above or below the others.

<br>The simplest of the three, in my opinion, is vibe. Vibe essentially refers to the feeling of the music. What kind of tone does it set? Does it seem to highjack your emotional systems and get you into ‘the feels,’ whether breakup depression or a new-romance high.

<br>Vibe-dominance in music is most commonly reflected in country music. It is extremely powerful at setting a mood and at seemingly highjacking the emotional systems of the listener. It’s a more abstract, emotionally driven draw.

      </ul>
      <h3>Expertise</h3>
      <p>
        Expertise refers to the excellence of the craftsman behind the work. How replicable is it, regardless of whether or not someone else could have come up with it easily or if it makes you feel a certain way or not? Do you have to be in the top 1% of the top 1%  of skilled performers in your domain to even begin attempting recreation? If so, you’ve probably found some high expertise music.

        <br>Examples include John Mayer, various forms of rock from mainstream guitar solos that require exquisite expertise to pull off to offshoots like math-rock or prog-rock which stray dizzyingly far into an expertise-centric model of music creation (complex rhythms constantly changing, multiple instruments or parts playing in different rhythms, abandonment of typical key signatures and/or constant changing thereof, etc)

      </ul>
      <h3>Creativity</h3>
      <p>
        Creativity is driven by interesting-ness and originality. Is it fascinating, new, and exciting to listen to? Likely creativity-centric.

<br>Examples of creativity-centric music include some mainstream creators like Kanye West, as well as countless obscure genres and bands such as Midwest-Emo, etc.

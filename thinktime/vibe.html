                <h1>Vibe - The Feels</h1>
                <p>The simplest of the three, in my opinion, is vibe. Vibe essentially refers to the feeling of the music. What kind of tone does it set? Does it seem to highjack your emotional systems and get you into ‘the feels,’ whether breakup depression or a new-romance high.

                        <h1>Country</h1>
                        <p>Vibe-dominance in music is most commonly reflected in country music. It is extremely powerful at setting a mood and at seemingly highjacking the emotional systems of the listener. It’s a more abstract, emotionally driven draw.</p>

                            <h1>Feel-good pop</h1>
                            <p>Feel-good pop serves as a quintessential example of vibe-based music preference. It's characterized by catchy melodies, uplifting lyrics, and an overall positive mood that resonates with listeners, eliciting feelings of happiness and joy.</p>

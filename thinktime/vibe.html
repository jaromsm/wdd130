                <h1>Vibe - The Feels</h1>
                <p>The simplest of the three, in my opinion, is vibe. Vibe essentially refers to the feeling of the music. What kind of tone does it set? Does it seem to highjack your emotional systems and get you into ‘the feels,’ whether breakup depression or a new-romance high.
                    Vibe-dominance in music is most commonly reflected in country music. It is extremely powerful at setting a mood and at seemingly highjacking the emotional systems of the listener. It’s a more abstract, emotionally driven draw.</p>

                <h1>Expertise</h1>
                <p>Expertise refers to the excellence of the craftsman behind the work. How replicable is it, regardless of whether or not someone else could have come up with it easily or if it makes you feel a certain way or not? Do you have to be in the top 1% of the top 1% of skilled performers in your domain to even begin attempting recreation? If so, you’ve probably found some high expertise music.</p>

                <p>Creativity is driven by interestingness and originality. Is it fascinating, new, and exciting to listen to? Likely creativity-centric.</p>
